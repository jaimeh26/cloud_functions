# cloud_functions

Create a Cloud Function that calculates the factorial of a given number( 5 marks+1 bonus if you could do with one cloud function calling another one with http trigger)
Create a Cloud Function that finds the maximum number in a list(the list can be initialized inside the cloud function) this is the list-->[4434,1233,7987,4567,3123,4356,9808,1211,7888,9328] 
Create a Cloud Function that finds the minimum number in a list(the list can be initialized inside the cloud function) this is the list-->[4434,1233,7987,4567,3123,4356,9808,1211,7888,9328] 
Create cloud function that sorts the above list in ascending order [4434,1233,7987,4567,3123,4356,9808,1211,7888,9328]  
Create cloud function that sorts the above list in descending order [4434,1233,7987,4567,3123,4356,9808,1211,7888,9328]
